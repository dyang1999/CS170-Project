# Fall 2022 CS170 Project

## Usage
Ensure that the directory you are running the solver in contains the CS170 Project.ipynb notebook, the starter.py code, and the inputs folder.  

Run cells in order. To run the solver, run the cells below Phase 2.  

To overwrite the existing output folder, edit the last cell from  

<code>run_all(solve6, 'inputs', 'output')</code> to 
<code>run_all(solve6, 'inputs', 'output', True)</code>.
